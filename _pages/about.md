I am a PhD candidate at the Discrete Mathematics and Optimization group at TU Delft in the Netherlands. I obtained a bachelor's degree in physics and a bachelor's and master's degree in mathematics at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl), Nijmegen.

Currently, all my projects revolve around problems in extremal geometry, i.e. problems of the form "What is the biggest set in an n-dimensional euclidean space with property X?". I work on finding upper bounds on the sizes of these sets by exposing such a problem as an independent set problem on an infinite (i.e. topological) graph.

During my master's I visited the George Mason Geometry Lab in Virginia, USA, for an honors program. In this project, I made [computer visualizations](https://buildings.gallery) of buildings for algebraic groups over finite and p-adic fields. We wrote a [nice paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17513472.2022.2063782?scroll=top&needAccess=true&role=tab&aria-labelledby=full-article) on this for the Journal of Mathematics and the Arts.
